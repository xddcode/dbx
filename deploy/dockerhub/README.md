## Quick Start

Set a strong access password and start DBX:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --pull=always \
  --name dbx \
  -p 4224:4224 \
  -e DBX_PASSWORD='change-this-password' \
  -v dbx-data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  t8y2/dbx:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:4224` and sign in with the value of `DBX_PASSWORD`.

The image supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

## Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  dbx:
    image: t8y2/dbx:latest
    pull_policy: always
    environment:
      DBX_PASSWORD: change-this-password
    ports:
      - "4224:4224"
    volumes:
      - dbx-data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  dbx-data:
```

Start or update the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d --pull always
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DBX_PASSWORD` | Not set | Access password for the DBX Web login page. Set a strong value for server deployments. |
| `DBX_DISABLE_PASSWORD` | `false` | Disables login protection when set to `true`. Do not use this on an untrusted network. |
| `DBX_DATA_DIR` | `/app/data` | Directory containing the DBX database, plugins, drivers, and other persistent data. |
| `DBX_PORT` | `4224` | HTTP port inside the container. |
| `DBX_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | `/` | URL prefix for reverse-proxy deployments, for example `/dbx`. |

Persist `/app/data` with a named volume or bind mount. Removing this data removes saved connections and other DBX application data.

## Reverse Proxy

To publish DBX under a path such as `https://example.com/dbx`, set:

```yaml
environment:
  DBX_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH: /dbx
```

Configure the reverse proxy to forward the same `/dbx` prefix to port `4224` in the container.

## China Mirror
